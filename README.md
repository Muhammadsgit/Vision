## Problem Statement
The project aims to develop and evaluate a machine learning model capable of classifying images of bottles into distinct categories based on their types. The dataset comprises synthetically generated images featuring various bottle classes scattered across random backgrounds [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vencerlanz09/bottle-synthetic-images-dataset 'Link to dataset') (). The current scope of the dataset includes five bottle classes: Plastic Bottles, Beer Bottles, Soda Bottles, Water Bottles, and Wine Bottles. The goal is to accurately categorize each image into one of these predefined classes.

This task addresses the challenges inherent in computer vision and image classification, particularly in dealing with synthetic imagery and diverse backgrounds. The project involves exploring and applying advanced machine learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, to achieve high accuracy in classification. 

Training an image classifier that is robust against real world out of distribution data is challenging task. Leveraging the powerful learned feature representations from VGG16 through transfer learning and fine-tuning can enable training a robust image classifier on limited data that generalizes well to real-world out-of-distribution examples.
